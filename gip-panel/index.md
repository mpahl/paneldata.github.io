## Study info 

The German Internet Panel (GIP) is a longitudinal panel survey of the Collaborative Research Center "Political Economy of Reforms" (SFB 884). 
As a SFB infrastructure project, the GIP collects data on individual attitudes and preferences relevant in political and economic decision-making processes. The data obtained the empirical basis for the scientific research of projects at the SFB 884.

The methodological composition of the GIP aims to build a panel study which on the one hand benefits from the advantages of online surveys (lower costs, higher flexibility) and on the other hand is representative for the entire German population (16 to 75 years).
Topics covered in the GIP are divers and include attitudes towards the reform policies, the welfare state, German an EU politics, health, social inequality, education, employment and key socio-demographic information.    
The GIP conducts online survey waves on an bi-monthly basis. The GIP is based on a probability sample of the general population in Germany aged 16 to 75. The initial sample was drawn by meand of strict random probability methods. Recruitment was conducted offline with face-to-face interviews, during which respondents were invited to the online panel.    
To ensure the representativeness of the online and offline population, the GIP includes respondents without computer and Internet access, by providing them with the necessary equipment and training.    
The GIP data are available to the scientific community via the GESIS Data Archive for the Social Sciences as scientific use file.    
The GIP currently collects data for research project at the SFB884 only. For this reason, we cannot accept questionnaire proposals from external researchers.

## Method

The GIP is the first internet panel that is representative of the entire German population.
In a first step, a true probability sample was built using an ADM-selection mechanism with separated random route address sampling. The sample frame consists of German-speaking individuals aged 16-75 living in private households.
Sample addresses were then compiled for a face-to-face recruitment interview. The interview was conducted with one household member. In this interview, eligible household members between the ages of 16 and 75 were identified. When consent was obtained in the recruitment interview, these eligible household members were sent an invitation letter to register for the GIP online panel.
Individuals without access to the internet or a computer were offered equipment and internet access free of charge (for further information see  equipment of offline-households http://reforms.uni-mannheim.de/internet_panel/equipment_of_offline_households/). 
When registered for the online panel, sample members receive invitations to the online panel every odd month. 
This recruitment procedure outlined here was followed during initial recruitment in 2012 and when recruiting a refreshment sample in 2014.
During initial recruitment, 5,500 households were contacted resulting in 2,543 face-to-face interviews. 1,603 individuals from these households registered for the GIP online survey.
In 2014, 9,386 addresses were used during recruitment of phase 2, the refreshment sample. 4,426 face-to-face interviews were realized, 4,034 individuals registered for the GIP online panel.
