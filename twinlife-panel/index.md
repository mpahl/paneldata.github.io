## Study info

TwinLife is a 12-year representative behavior genetic study investigating the development of social inequality. 
The long-term project started in 2014 and will survey more than 4,000 pairs of twins and their families regarding their different stages of life on a yearly basis. All of the subjects reside in Germany. Not only social, but also genetic mechanisms as well as covariations and interactions between these two parameters can be examined based on the data from identical and fraternal twins. In order to document the individual development of different parameters it is important to examine a family extensively over the course of several years. The focus is on five important contextual aspects: education and academic performance, career and labor market attainment, integration and participation in social, cultural and political life, quality of life and perceived capabilities, and, if relevant, behavioral issues and deviant behavior. The data provide insight into questions about the development and evolution of social inequalities and will be provided for use by the research community.

## Method

Through the implementation of the cross-sequential design TwinLife will observe four cohorts of identical and fraternal twins over a period of twelve years. For this purpose, annual interviews will be conducted alternately via telephone or home visits.
This design enables the examination of a great age range within the short period of twelve years. The youngest cohort (born in 2009) was five years old in the first panel wave in 2014 and the oldest cohort (born in 1991) will be 31 years old in the last wave in 2023.     
In consequence, the assessment begins shortly before school enrollment and ceases when most of the career-related decisions have been made.
In TwinLife the nuclear twin family design (NTFD) is applied in a special form as the focus not only lies on the biological family but on the complete environment that the twins grow up in, thus if applicable also including the step-family members. If it is the case that the twins grow up in a step-family or some kind of patch-work family, the biological parents will assessed, too. Also, the study will record separation and divorce or other individuals moving into the household as these are very important life events. Furthermore, when the twins have reached a certain age spouses will be included since they represent an important environmental factor.
