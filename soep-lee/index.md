##Study info

The overall goal of the study was to produce a linked employer employee (LEE) data set for the German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP).  More specifically, the objectives of the project were, firstly, the realisation of a representative employer survey, secondly, the provision of the respective workplace data set which can be either used individually or in conjunction with the individual and household data from the SOEP study, and thirdly, a methodological analysis of the data collection process, contributing to the survey methodology of organizational studies.
The workplace data collected during the study can be linked to the individual and household level data from the SOEP and will substantially expand the information on the organizational contexts and working conditions of respondents to the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey. The enhancement of a nationally representative individual- and household panel survey by means of a proper employer survey represents a crucial innovation for the social science. The resulting data set will be unique within Germany, as there is no linked data set with comparable size and richness of individual and household level information so far. This new linked employer-employee dataset offers new possibilities for wide-ranging secondary analyses with innovative research questions from the social- and economic sciences, such as the analysis of the effect of inner-organizational income inequalities (organizational characteristic) on the sense of justice towards overall wage differentials (individual characteristic, surveyed in the SOEP 2011).
An additional unique feature of SOEP-LEE study is the collection of paradata and metadata over the course of data collection by which the data quality can be analysed. As a result, the project also contributed to the development of the survey methodology in the organizational studies.  

##Method

In 2012, all employees in the SOEP sample were asked to provide the contact information of their local employer they were working for (in the month of the 2011 SOEP interview). The response rate at this stage was approximately 85 % and yielded 6549 valid addresses of establishments. These addresses formed the basis for a survey of establishments conducted in autumn and winter 2012/2013 (employers with less than five employees were excluded due to confidentiality reasons) which resulted in 1708 successful interviews. The adjusted response rate at the establishment level was 30.2%. 
Due to this sampling procedure, employers throughout Germany across all lines of business from the private-; public and tertiary sector (associations and foundations) were interviewed. The employee-first-method mimics a sampling design where establishments are drawn randomly with an inclusion probability proportional to their size, i.e. their number of employees. For the use of the data at the establishment level, a design weight will be computed proportional to the inverse of the number of employees.
The data collection of the SOEP-LEE study was assigned to TNS Infratest Sozialforschung Munich. The survey was in the field from the beginning of August 2012 until the middle of March 2013 and used personal interviewing with a fully structured paper and pencil questionnaire (PAPI) and the possibility of self-completion if requested. The questionnaire was administered face-to-face and comprised 61 questions and 161 items which took about 40 minutes to complete on average. In order to facilitate the contact process, the fieldwork organisation sent an advance letter and an information flyer to the enterprises, explaining the purpose of the upcoming survey. 

##Data access

Dissemination alongside the normal SOEP data is restricted due to the sensibility of the data and the risk of a potential identification of individual establishments. The data set will be available for secondary use at two data archives in Germany, the SOEP-RDC at DIW Berlin and the DSZ-BO at Bielefeld University. Researchers will need to apply for a research stay at the SOEP or the DSZ-BO. All outputs will be checked to assure the confidentiality of the information provided.

##Data description

This establishment data from the study can be linked to individual and household data from the SOEP study. Linking SOEP survey data to the establishment data is possible for 1834 individuals (there were several establishments with more than one SOEP-employee). Two datasets are provided: an establishment level file (slee_estab) containing the information from the establishment interviews and a sample file (slee_sample). For linkage to the SOEP data, the standard person identifier persnr can be used. First, individual SOEP data should be matched to the SOEP-LEE sample file using persnr. Second, the establishment level data should be matched using the establishment identifier eid. 

##Other material and Notes

The survey report on the conduction of the fieldwork appears together with the questionnaires and a detailed codebook in the SOEP Survey Papers series.
