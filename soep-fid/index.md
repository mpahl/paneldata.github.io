##Study info

The project “Familien in Deutschland“ – “families in Germany“ – is a longitudinal panel study financed by the German Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) and the German Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF). Its main purpose is to provide researchers with new and better data on specific groups in the German population: low-income families, families with more than two children, single-parent families as well as families with young children. The data are the backbone of the first large-scale evaluation of family policy measures in Germany on behalf of the two involved ministries. 

##Method

The role model for this project is the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), a representative study of the German population which runs annually since 1984. FiD is modeled after the SOEP in structure (as a household sample with individual interviews) and in terms of its questionnaire content. However, the sample was drawn and weighted to represent the following four groups of the German population:   

* 1. Families in "critical income brackets"
* 2. Single parents
* 3. Families with more than two children
* 4. Cohorts of children born between 2007 and 2010

The first three samples were selected through a screening process, which defined eligibility for households through a brief telephone interview before the actual interview. These three samples are thus often referred to as the “Screening Sample 2010”. The fourth group was selected through random sampling from German registries, and is referred to as the “Cohort Sample”. 
Participants answered several questionnaires on a household and individual level as well as additional proxy-questionnaires about their children in certain age-groups. The topics addressed are similar to those in the SOEP-Study with an additional focus on family issues.
All interviews were conducted in face-to-face mode, i.e., with an interviewer present during the interview. The general mode of the interviews was CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interview), but some questionnaires allowed for a PAPI (Pen and Paper Interview) mode as well. 
In 2010, wave 1 started containing overall 4,574 interviewed households with a total of 17,002 individuals. There are a total of 17,352 different interviews available, which include household interviews, individual interviews, and proxy interviews for children living in the household. Especially the latter provide valuable information for evaluation purposes. The longitudinal dimension started with wave 2 in 2011. Here, an additional subsample of 924 single-parents households as well as households with more than two children was added to the study, called the “Screening Sample 2011”.  

Due to the different sampling strategies employed, it is not possible to report a single response rate for FiD. The Cohort Sample allows for a straightforward calculation of the response rate, which was almost 40%. Migrant households (identified as described above) are significantly less likely to participate than German households (a difference of 23 percentage points).
For households in the Screening Samples, for which the eligibility could be determined, around 70% participated in the respective first waves of 2010 and 2011. Once the households took part, they were relatively likely to stay in the study: the household retention rates are slightly higher in the Screening Sample 2010 than in the Cohort Sample (86 vs. 79% in 2011, 89 vs. 83% in 2012), but both samples show a positive trend as is usual for the beginning of a panel-study.

##Questionnaires

The questionnaires which are all only in German,  can be found under [Website,Dokumentaion FID] (http://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.405871.de/fid_dokumentation.html).

##Data access

The data from “Familien in Deutschland” are available for use by the scientific community. Researchers who have signed a data contact with the SOEP are authorized to order the FID-dataset as well.

###Data description

The structure of the FiD-data corresponds to the SOEP with respect to the types of datasets, key variables and missing codes. It is intended for a combined use with the SOEP-data.
