## Study info

The IAB-SOEP Migration Sample is a joint project of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) and the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW). The project attempts to overcome limitations of previous datasets by drawing a sample that takes into account changes in the structure of migration to Germany since 1995. The dataset is a supplementary sample to the SOEP-Core study and therefore completely harmonized with the SOEP and integrated into SOEP v30 (identical questionnaire with additional questions on the respondent's migration situation). The study opens up new perspectives for migration research and gives insights on the living situations of new immigrants to Germany.

## Method

The complete set of questionnaires and addtional documents for the fieldwork are available as SOEP Survey Papers:

- [Questionnaires (DE)](http://panel.gsoep.de/soep-docs/surveypapers/diw_ssp0218.pdf)
- [Questionnaires (EN,TU,PL,RO,RS)](http://panel.gsoep.de/soep-docs/surveypapers/diw_ssp0219.pdf)
- [Survey instruments 2013 (wave 30) of the Socio-Economic Panel: supplementary instruments](http://panel.gsoep.de/soep-docs/surveypapers/diw_ssp0199.pdf)

The questionnaire covers the complete migration, education, and labor market histories of respondents in both their country of origin and in all countries in which they have lived. Additionally, the questionnaire includes several new batteries of questions that have not previously been included in the SOEP or other household surveys in Germany, or not in the necessary depth. Examples include questions on earnings and labor market integration and occupational status before migration, migration decisions in the family and partnership context, and purposes and transfer channels of remittances.

The IAB-SOEP Migration Sample substantially increases the sample size of the SOEP-Core study for research on migration and the lives of immigrants in Germany. 4,964 persons residing in 2,723 households participated in the first wave of the survey. Since the survey is also included in the regular SOEP, migrants from the other SOEP-Core samples can be included in analyses, increasing the number of observations further.

The dataset is available upon request for free and can be downloaded from a secure server with an individual password. For more information on the SOEP application process, see: [Access to the SOEP data] (http://www.diw.de/en/diw_02.c.222871.en/contract_management.html).

At the IAB Research Data Center: The normal application process at the [IAB RDC](http://fdz.iab.de/en/FDZ_Data_Access.aspx) should be followed.

The survey data is distributed to all SOEP users automatically as of SOEP Version 30, released in fall 2014. As of early 2015, the data from the IAB-SOEP Migration Sample along with the linked information from the register-based IAB dataset, are available at IAB Research Data Center. The data are weakly anonymized and available for analysis in the framework of a guest visit to the IAB in Nuremberg or other external locations.

## Data description

The data structure is closly related to the structure used in the SOEP-Core study. Each wave (survey year) is identified by letters of the alphabet: the first wave in 1984 is wave "A", 1985 is wave "B", 2009 is wave "Z", followed by wave "BA" in 2010 and so on. Therefore survey year 2013 is identified by wave prefix "BD". For each year of SOEP data there are seperate data files for households (e.g., BDH) as well as for individual respondents (e.g., BDP and BDP_MIG) and children (e.g., BDKIND) based on interview information. These observations make up the net population, with each of these files containing as many records as interviews could be conducted. Additional data files with a limited number of variables based on the address log constitute the gross number of households and persons, i.e. all households and househod members that were eligible for an interview in any given year.

### Missing conventions

Survey variables might be missing, i.e., without a valid code or value for different reasons. In the SOEP, negative values are not valid for any variable, but are used instead to code different reasons for missing information. There are two distinctions for missing values: they may originate in the respondent's answer or in the survey design.
|Code | Meaning|
|:----:|-----|
|-1|no answer /don`t know|
|-2|does not apply|
|-3|implausible value|
|-4|inadmissible multiple response|
|-5|not included in this version of the questionnaire|
|-6|version of questionnaire with modified filtering|

With the extension of the SOEP in recent years, entirely new samples like the IAB-SOEP-Migration Sample have been added to the core. In these samples questions are sometimes left out completely, for instance to shorten the questionnaire or because the focus of the sample is different. In such a case, the variable will be set to "-5 Not included in this version of the questionnaire" for an entire subsample.

With the use of CAPI, recent developments include an integrated individual and biographical questionnaire, i.e., the biographical part and the regular part of the questionnaire are combined into one questionnaire. Some of the questions in the biographical part are repeated in the regular part. While in the PAPI mode, the respondent will answer the same question twice, the CAPI makes it possible to filter the respondent around the question if it has already been asked. These cases are very rare: if they occur, they receive a code "-6 Version of questionnaire with modified filtering".
